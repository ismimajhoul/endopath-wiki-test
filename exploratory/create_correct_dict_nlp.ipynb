prise de tramadol ça s est calmé   du coup j ai continué le tramadol pendant les 2 jours qui ont suivi car j y sentait encore un peu et j avais peur que ça se réveille     pensez vous que ça peut être du à l endométriose ou faut il que j aille consulter et vérifier l appendice   merci cordialement répondu fg le 20 03 2018 à 21h13   chère madame dhers je nai pas encore pris le temps de vous
